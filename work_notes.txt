downloaded excel file from airlinerlist.com

copied part of the table containing a330 and a340 to a seperate excel file, saved this file in csv format.

created rstudio-project.

attempted to upload csv file to rstudio but encountered flaw: table only had 1 column.

cleaned the table up in openrefine (removed irrelevant columns) and exported the file in csv format.

read the csv file from openrefine in rstudio and it now worked.
